## Features

- **High-Quality Documentation**: Generates clear and detailed documentation tailored to your code.
- **Context-Aware**: Understands the context of your code to provide relevant documentation.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilizes multiple agents to process and document your code efficiently.
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Breaks down complex code into manageable sections for easier documentation.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface that makes it easy for anyone to use.

## Installation

To install DocAgent, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LAYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO/DocAgent.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DocAgent
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Usage

To use DocAgent, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python docagent.py [path_to_your_python_code]
```

Replace `[path_to_your_python_code]` with the path to the Python codebase you want to document. DocAgent will analyze the code and generate documentation in a structured format.

## How It Works

DocAgent employs a multi-agent architecture to analyze and document your Python code. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of the code, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Code Analysis**: Each agent inspects different parts of the code, such as functions, classes, and modules.
2. **Context Understanding**: Agents understand the context of the code to generate relevant documentation.
3. **Hierarchical Structuring**: The documentation is organized hierarchically, making it easy to navigate and understand.
4. **Output Generation**: Finally, DocAgent compiles the findings into a well-structured document.
